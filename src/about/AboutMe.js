      <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>What motivates me most to be a software engineer is that I love to work creatively to solve complex puzzles as a part of a team. I can’t imagine a better opportunity to do that than software engineering!</p>
        <p>I've been an elementary teacher and instructional coach for the past 8 years and much of what I cherished in that profession I hope to experience as a software engineer. Each school year was like managing a new project with the goal of maximizing student learning. I worked closely with specialists to meet my students’ needs and analyzed student data regularly to monitor their progress and ensure we were on track to meet our goals. In addition, I returned to my classroom and adapted the curriculum to meet the needs of my students. Each year my students, families and teammates changed making some aspects smoother and others more challenging. I loved that process!</p>
        <p>I’m hoping to experience a similar process in software engineering. I want to be part of a team that completes complex projects that help businesses meet their goals. I want to engage in creative conversations about how to develop programs and then go work to bring those conversations to life in the code we write.</p>
